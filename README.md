## About

Voom is an SEO-optimized and accessibility friendly frontend only courier website built on React Js framework.

### Project goal

The major aim of this project was to levarage third party API calls to third-party data provider.
The Geoapify Api was used here to detect users location based on their IP address.
While this method of user location determination is not the most accurate and can be hindered by the use of
client side VPNs, it is the least obtrusive and less likely to fail for users without location permission.
